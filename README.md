Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial intelligence is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
AI is also defined as,
    • An Intelligent Entity Created By humans
    • Capable of Performing Tasks intelligently without being explicitly instructed.
    • Capable of thinking and acting rationally and humanely.

AI Perspectives: acting and thinking humanly, acting and thinking rationally:

    1. Acting Humanly: The Turing Test approach – Acting like a human.
    2. Thinking Humanly: The cognitive modeling approach – Thinking like a person.
    3. Thinking Rationally: The laws of thought approach – Thinking rationally is a logical process and it concludes based on symbolic logic. The famous syllogisms, “Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal.”
    4. Acting Rationally: The rational agent approach – Rational agent acts to achieve high value and brings the best possible outcome for any given task.


       
History Of AI

The history of artificial intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.
The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, USA during the summer of 1956.Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation, and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.
Eventually, it became obvious that commercial developers and researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. In 1974, in response to the criticism from James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from congress, the U.S. and British Governments stopped funding undirected research into artificial intelligence, and the difficult years that followed would later be known as an "AI winter". Seven years later, a visionary initiative by the Japanese Government inspired governments and industry to provide AI with billions of dollars, but by the late 80s the investors became disillusioned and withdrew funding again.
Investment and interest in AI boomed in the first decades of the 21st century when machine learning was successfully applied to many problems in academia and industry due to new methods, the application of powerful computer hardware, and the collection of immense data sets.

 Foundations of AI: 

Philosophy:
    • Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?
    • How does the mind arise from a physical brain?
    • Where does knowledge come from?

    • How does knowledge lead to action?
      
      Aristotle (384–322 BCE) was the first to formulate a precise set of laws governing the rational part of the mind. He developed an informal system of syllogisms for proper reasoning, which in principle allowed one to generate conclusions mechanically, given initial premises.
      Ramon Llull (c. 1232–1315) devised a system of reasoning published as Ars Magna or The Great Art (1305). Llull tried to implement his system using an actual mechanical device: a set of paper wheels that could be rotated into different permutations.
Around 1500, Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) designed but did not build a mechanical calculator; recent reconstructions have shown the design to be functional. The first known calculating machine was constructed around 623 by the German scientist Wilhelm Schickard (1592–1635).

Mathematics

    • What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?
      
    • What can be computed?
      
    • How do we reason with uncertain information?

The idea of formal logic can be traced back to the philosophers of ancient Greece, India, and China, but its mathematical development really began with the work of George Boole (1815–1864), who worked out the details of propositional, or Boolean, logic (Boole, 1847).
In 1879, Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) extended Boole’s logic to include objects and relations, creating the first-order logic that is used today.
Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576) first framed the idea of probability, describing it in terms of the possible outcomes of gambling events.
In 1654, Blaise Pascal (1623–1662), in a letter to Pierre Fermat (1601– 1665), showed how to predict the future of an unfinished gambling game and assign average payoffs to the gamblers

Economics

    • How should we make decisions in accordance with our preferences?
    • How should we do this when others may not go along?
    • How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?
    • The science of economics originated in 1776, when Adam Smith (1723–1790)               published An Inquiry into the Nature                  
      and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.              

Léon Walras (pronounced “Valrasse”) (1834–1910) gave utility theory a more general foundation in terms of preferences between gambles on any outcomes (not just monetary outcomes). The theory was improved by Ramsey (1931) and later by John von Neumann
and Oskar Morgenstern in their book The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944). Economics is no longer the study of money; rather it is the study of desires and preferences.

Economists, with some exceptions, did not address the third question listed above: how to make rational decisions when payoffs from actions are not immediate but instead result from several actions taken in sequence.


Neuroscience

    • How do brains process information?

Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, particularly the brain.

Paul Broca’s (1824–1880) investigation of aphasia (speech deficit) in brain-damaged patients in 1861 initiated the study of the brain’s functional organization by identifying a localized area in the left hemisphere—now called Broca’s area—that is responsible for speech production.

By that time, it was known that the brain consisted largely of nerve cells, or neurons, but it was not until 1873 that Camillo Golgi (1843–1926) developed a staining technique allowing the observation of individual neurons (see Figure 1.1 ).

This technique was used by Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852–1934) in his pioneering studies of neuronal organization. It is now widely accepted that cognitive functions result from the electrochemical operation of these structures. That is, a collection of simple cells can lead to thought, action, and consciousness. In the pithy words of John Searle (1992), brains cause minds.

Psychology

    • How do humans and animals think and act?

The origins of scientific psychology are usually traced to the work of the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) and his student Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920).
In 1879, Wundt opened the first laboratory of experimental psychology, at the University of Leipzig.
Cognitive psychology, which views the brain as an information-processing device, can be traced back at least to the works of William James (1842–1910). Helmholtz also insisted that perception involved a form of unconscious logical inference. The cognitive viewpoint was largely eclipsed by behaviorism in the United States, but at Cambridge’s Applied Psychology Unit, directed by Frederic Bartlett (1886–1969), cognitive modeling was able to
flourish.

Computer Engineering

    • How can we build an efficient computer?

The first operational computer was the electromechanical Heath Robinson,9 built in 1943 by Alan Turing’s team for a single purpose: deciphering German messages.
In 1943, the same group developed the Colossus, a powerful general-purpose machine based on vacuum tubes.
The first operational programmable computer was the Z-3, the invention of Konrad Zuse in Germany in 1941. The first electronic computer, the ABC, was assembled by John Atanasoff and his student Clifford Berry between 1940 and 1942 at Iowa State University.

We are just beginning to see hardware tuned for AI applications, such as the graphics processing unit (GPU), tensor processing unit (TPU), and wafer scale engine (WSE). From the 1960s to about 2012, the amount of computing power used to train top machine learning applications followed Moore’s law. A machine learning model that took a
full day to train in 2014 takes only two minutes in 2018 (Ying et al., 2018). Although it is not yet practical,quantum computing holds out the promise of far greater accelerations for some important sub classes of AI algorithms.

Control Theory

    • How can artifacts operate under their own control?

Ktesibios of Alexandria (c. 250 BCE) built the first self-controlling machine: a water clock with a regulator that maintained a constant flow rate. Modern control theory, especially the branch known as stochastic optimal control, has as its goal the design of systems that maximize a cost function over time. This roughly matches the standard model of AI: designing systems that behave optimally. Why, then, are AI and control theory two different fields, despite the close connections among their founders? The answer lies in the close coupling between the mathematical techniques that were familiar to the participants and the corresponding sets of problems that were encompassed in each world view. Calculus and matrix algebra, the tools of control theory, lend themselves to systems that are describable by fixed sets of continuous variables, whereas AI was founded in part as a way to escape from these perceived limitations. The tools of logical inference and computation allowed AI researchers to consider problems such as language, vision, and symbolic planning that fell completely outside the control theorist’s purview.

Linguistics

    • How does language relate to thought?
In 1957, B. F. Skinner published Verbal Behavior. the linguist Noam Chomsky, who had just published a book on his own theory, Syntactic Structures. Modern linguistics and AI, then, were “born” at about the same time, and grew up together, intersecting in a hybrid field called computational linguistics or natural language processing. The problem of understanding language turned out to be considerably more complex than it seemed in 1957. Understanding language requires an understanding of the subject matter and context, not just an understanding of the structure of sentences. This might seem obvious, but it was not widely appreciated until the 1960s. Much of the early work in knowledge representation (the study of how to put knowledge into a form that a computer can reason with) was tied to language and informed by research in linguistics, which was connected in turn to decades of work on the philosophical analysis of language.
